If you are going to change the parameters in the encrypting file, you need to adapt some parameters in the decryption file
You will always need to adapt the coordinates of DID and you need to copy the last output line of this file to properly decrypt
-------------------------------
The prime number q is: 56453
The prime number p is: 338717
Third root of unit is: 0 (mod 338717) + 1 (mod 338717) x^1 over F_{338717^2}
First value of the cyphertext: (19421 (mod 338717),216430 (mod 338717))
Second value of the cyphertext: bytearray(b'\x01P\x02\x04\x04\x07\x07\x08\x08')
This is a hex representation of the encrypted message.This hex-code needs to be entered to the decryption script: 015002040407070808
